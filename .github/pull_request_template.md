Thank you for making a pull request!

Clean React App is built and maintained by developers like you, and we appreciate contributions very much. You are awesome!

Here is a short checklist to give your PR the best start:

_Everything above can be removed once checked_

- [ ] Commit messages are ready to go in the changelog (see below for details)
- [ ] PR template filled in (see below for details)

# Commit messages

Our changelog is automatically built from our commit history, using conventional changelog. This means we'd like to take care that:

- commit messages with the prefix `fix:` or `fix(foo):` are suitable to be added to the changelog under "Fixes and improvements"
- commit messages with the prefix `feat:` or `feat(foo):` are suitable to be added to the changelog under "New features"

If you've made many commits that don't adhere to this style, we recommend squashing 
your commits to a new branch before making a PR. Alternatively, we can do a squash
merge, but you'll lose attribution for your change.

For more information please see CONTRIBUTING.md
